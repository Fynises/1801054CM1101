        My name is Fraser Irvine. I am a university student of The Robert Gordon University of Aberdeen City, Scotland.

      <p>
        I am currently studying Computer Science, aiming for a Bachelors of Science with Honours degree and i hope to use this degree to find employment in the field of computing. and or to further my education in Postgraduate study for a Masters Degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am very knowledgeable in computer devices and i strive to learn more. I was raised with computer technology from an early age, starting from playing PC games to building my PC to then find a passion that would ultimately land myself into a university to study more about computing devices
      </p>
      <p>
        Ethnically I am a mixed race of half-British and half-Chinese. with my Father's side being British and my Mother's side being Chinese. I was born in Shenzhen, China: nicknamed "The Silicon Valley of the east" due to the massive industry of computer hardware manufacturing and IT services.
        since my birth. i had lived in China for the first 11 years of my life. my time there had made me aquainted with the Chinese Language
