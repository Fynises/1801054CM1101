              this website was meant for a coursework project for university.

              This planned project of mine is going to be an RPG game
            </p>
            <p>
              The title of this game is hidden for now and will be known by its codename.
            </p>
            <p>
              The inspiration for this RPG game comes from the early Final Fantasy Series. particularly Final Fantasty to Final Fantasy VI.
              The inspiration being a Top down view fantasy story RPG in which the player and his/her companions follow a story whilst battling various foes
            </p>
            <p>
              This game will feature original characters. A hugely vast hand crafted world and a uniqe combat system.
